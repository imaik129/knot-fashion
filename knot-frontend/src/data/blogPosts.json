          "Sizing systems emerged from marketing, not anatomy. In the early 20th century, brands created size charts to standardize production, but they were based on limited body data and often skewed toward specific demographics. As fashion became more commercial, brands realized they could manipulate sizing to make customers feel better about their purchases.",
          "Vanity sizing is the practice of labeling larger garments with smaller numbers. A brand might call a garment that measures 34 inches at the waist a 'size 8' instead of a 'size 12' to flatter shoppers. This isn't universal—some brands do the opposite (running small) to appeal to customers who want to feel they fit into smaller sizes. The result is complete chaos: there's no standard for what a size 8 actually means.",
          "Brand drift compounds the problem. As companies chase different customer segments, their size blocks shift. A brand targeting younger customers might make sizes smaller and tighter; one targeting professionals might add more ease. Even within a single brand, sizing can change season to season as designers adjust patterns. The size label on a garment tells you almost nothing about whether it will fit your body."

Even when you match the chart perfectly, the garment might not fit because the chart doesn't account for how fabric drapes, stretches, or behaves on your specific body shape.",
          "Trying on multiple sizes in stores works, but it's time-consuming and frustrating. Online shopping makes this worse—you're forced to guess, often ordering two or three sizes and returning the ones that don't fit. This guessing game costs time, money, and creates waste. As we explore in [Why Online Clothing Returns Are So High](/blogs/why-online-clothing-returns-are-high), returns are mostly fit failures.",

This is efficient because most of the pattern work is already done; the maker just tweaks it to fit your body.",

        "answer": "No. Modern AI body scanning uses just a phone camera—no special equipment, no depth sensors, no expensive scanners. You record a short video while rotating slowly, and the AI builds a 3D model from that video."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is phone-based body scanning?",
        "answer": "Very accurate for most measurements. Modern AI models can infer 3D shape from 2D video with high accuracy. The system captures key dimensions (bust, waist, hip, inseam, etc.) within a few millimeters, which is sufficient for garment matching. Quality checks ensure reliability."

      {
        "question": "How long does the scanning process take?",
        "answer": "Usually 30-60 seconds from video to measurements. You record a short video (10-30 seconds) while rotating slowly, and the AI processes it automatically. The process is fast and practical for everyday use."

        "question": "Why did clothes get less durable?",
        "answer": "As production scaled up, fabrics got thinner, construction got cheaper, and care habits changed. The goal was to hit lower price points, which required compromises in fabric quality, construction, and durability. Each compromise shaved off a bit of lifespan."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I still find durable clothes today?",
        "answer": "Yes, but you need to look for quality indicators: higher-density fabrics, strong seam finishes, reinforcement at stress points, and brands that publish make standards. Avoid garments with glued components, weak seams, or minimal finishing—these are signs of planned obsolescence."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does fit really affect durability?",
        "answer": "Yes. A garment that pulls, strains, or fights your body is under constant stress, which shows up as seam failures and fabric thinning. Better fit spreads load more evenly, so pieces last longer. Fit is a hidden factor in durability."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I make clothes last longer?",
        "answer": "Choose quality construction, care for garments properly (cooler washes, air drying when possible), and mend when needed. Better fit also extends lifespan by reducing stress and making garments more comfortable. When possible, choose made-to-measure or well-fitting standard sizes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it worth paying more for durability?",
        "answer": "Often, yes. A more expensive garment that lasts 5 years has lower cost per wear than a cheaper garment that lasts 1 year. When you factor in lifespan, durability often pays for itself. Better fit also extends lifespan, making it a good investment."
