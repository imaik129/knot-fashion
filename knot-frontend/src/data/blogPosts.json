      "If you’ve ever pulled an old jacket from a parent’s wardrobe and wondered why it still feels solid, you’re not imagining it. Many everyday garments used to be built with heavier fabrics, stricter quality standards, and an assumption that they should last for years, not a single season.",
      "Over time, volume and speed reshaped how clothes were made. Mills shifted from dense, natural fibers to cheaper blends and lighter weaves. The goal wasn’t to make something fall apart—but to hit a price point and move on to the next drop. Each tiny compromise shaved off a bit of lifespan.",
      "Construction changed too. Classic tailoring and workwear used higher stitches per inch, strong seam finishes, generous facings, and reinforcement at stress points like shoulders, crotch, and pockets. As margins tightened, many of those invisible details were trimmed away: fewer stitches, narrower seams, glued instead of stitched components.",
      "Care habits drifted in the same direction. When wardrobes were smaller, people aired garments out, spot-cleaned, and mended. As clothes got cheaper and more abundant, laundering became more aggressive—hotter washes, harsher detergents, more tumble-drying—which accelerates wear on already-delicate fabrics and seams.",
      "Fit quietly plays a role in longevity as well. A garment that pulls at the shoulder, strains at the seat, or fights your posture is under constant stress. That stress shows up first as seam failures and fabric thinning in high-tension zones. Better fit spreads load more evenly, so pieces last longer simply because they’re not fighting your body.",
      "Bringing durability back doesn’t require going backwards—it means being more deliberate. Look for higher-density fabrics, clean finishing on the inside, reinforcement where the garment bends, and brands that publish make standards instead of just trend language. When possible, choose pieces you can alter and repair rather than replace.",
      "The future of clothing doesn’t have to copy the past, but it can borrow its logic: fewer pieces, built well, that actually fit. When fabric spec, construction, and fit all aim at longevity, clothes stop behaving like disposables and start feeling like part of your personal archive."
